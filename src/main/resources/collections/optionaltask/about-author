Theodore Herman Albert Dreiser was an American novelist and journalist of the naturalist school. His novels often featured main characters who
succeeded at their objectives despite a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble studies of nature than
tales of choice and agency. Dreisers best known novels include Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925).
